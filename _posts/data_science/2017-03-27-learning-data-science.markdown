<h4>In this semester,</h4>

I'm taking a data science class of Prof. Yeongseok Lee now. It is quite cool project. I've only heard about what data science is before but never got experienced.

This class takes R language, maybe best ever big data science language but not for me :), and also python with pandas and numpy. It is totally challenging! Script languages always have been challenges to me all time. Thus I'd like to write all things down what I struggled with in here. Hope it helped if you have same troubles what I already had.
